Interface change of smatch.py and smatch-table.py. Using this version does not require esem-format-check.pl. (All versions before v0.5 require esem-format-check.pl to check the format of AMR) Instead it needs amr.py.

It now accepts one-AMR-per-line format as well as other formats of AMR. 

smatch.py now equals to smatch-v0.5.py
smatch-table.py now equals to smatch-table-v0.3.py
